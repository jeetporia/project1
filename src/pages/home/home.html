        <h3 no-padding>Angular 2</h3>
        <p no-margin>Angular 2 is an open source JavaScript framework to build web applications in
             HTML and JavaScript. This tutorial looks at the various aspects of Angular 2 framework 
             which includes the basics of the framework, the setup of Angular and how to work with 
             the various aspects of the framework. Other topics discussed in the tutorial are advanced 
             chapters such as interfaces, nested components and services within Angular. 
             Topics such as routing, modules, and arrays are also dealt with in this tutorial.

        <h3 no-padding padding-top>Audience</h3>
        <p no-margin>This tutorial is for those who are interested in learning the new version 
            of the Angular framework. The first version of the framework has been there for 
            quite some time and it is only off-late that Angular 2 has become popular with 
            the web development community.</p>

        <h3 no-padding padding-top>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p no-margin>The user should be familiar with the basics of web development 
            and JavaScript. Since the Angular framework is built on the JavaScript 
            framework, it becomes easier for the user to understand Angular if they 
            know JavaScript. </p>
