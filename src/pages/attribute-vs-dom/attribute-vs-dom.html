      <h2>HTML Attribute vs DOM property</h2>

      <p> In this video we will discuss the difference between HTML attribute and DOM property.</p>

      <h2>
        What is DOM
      </h2>

      <p>
        DOM stands for Document Object Model. When a browser loads a web page, the browser creates a Document Object Model of that
        page.
      </p>

      <p>
        In simple terms you can think of the DOM as an application programming interface (API) for HTML, and we can use programming
        languages like JavaScript, or JavaScript frameworks like Angular to access and manipulate the HTML using their corresponding
        DOM objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words DOM contains the HTML elements as objects, their properties, methods and events and it is a standard for accessing,
        modifying, adding or deleting HTML elements.
      </p>

        In the previous 2 videos we discussed interpolation and property binding in Angular.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interpolation Example
      </p>

      <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="1">
        <button disabled ={isDisabled}}> Click </button>
      </textarea>

      <p>
        Property Binding Example
      </p>

      <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="1">
        <button [disabled] = 'isDisabled'>Click me </button>
      </textarea>

      <p>
        If you notice the above 2 examples, it looks like we are binding to the Button's disabled attribute. This is not true. We
        are actually binding to the disabled property of the button object. Angular data-binding is all about binding to
        DOM object properties and not HTML element attributes.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is the difference between HTML element attribute and DOM property Attributes are defined by HTML, where as properties
        are defined by the DOM. Attributes initialize DOM properties. Once the initialization complete, the attributes job
        is done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Property values can change, where as attribute values can't.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's prove this point - Property values change, but the attribute values don't with an example
      </p>

      <p>
        In the example below, we have set the value attribute of the input element to Tom.
      </p>
  
    
    <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="1">
      <input id='inputid' type="text" value="Tom">
    </textarea>

    <p>
      At this point run the web page and in the textbox you will see 'Tom' as the value
    </p>

    <p>
      Launch the browser developer tools
    </p>

    <p>
      On the 'Console' tab, use the getattribute() method and value property of the input element to get the 
      attribute and property values. Notice at the moment both have the value 'Tom'
    </p>

    <p>
      Change the value in the textbox to Mary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice now, when we query for the attribute and property values, the attribute value is still 
      Tom but the property value is Mary. 
      So this proves the point - Property values change, where as attribute values don't.
    </p>

    <p>
      So it is important to keep in mind that, HTML attributes and the DOM properties are different things. 
      Angular binding works with properties and events, and not attributes. 
      The role of attributes is to initialize element properties and their job is done.
