      <p>In this video we will discuss Attribute Binding in Angular </p>
      <p>
        In our previous videos we discussed Interpolation and Property binding that deal with binding Component class properties
        to HTML element properties and not Attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in some situations we want to be able to bind to HTML element attributes. For example, colspan and aria attributes
        does not have corresponding DOM properties. So in this case we want to be able to bind to HTML element attributes.
      </p>
      <!--old code -->
      <p>
        In simple terms you can think of the DOM as an application programming interface (API) for HTML, and we can use programming
        languages like JavaScript, or JavaScript frameworks like Angular to access and manipulate the HTML using their corresponding
        DOM objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words DOM contains the HTML elements as objects, their properties, methods and events and it is a standard for accessing,
        modifying, adding or deleting HTML elements.
      </p>

        To make this happen, Angular provides attribute binding. With attribute binding we can set the value of an attribute directly.
        Angular team recommends to use Property binding when possible and use attribute binding only when there is no corresponding
        element property to bind
