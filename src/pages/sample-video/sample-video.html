            Angular 1 was released in October 2010, Angular 1 was released in October 2010, and by 
            far the most popular JavaScript framework available for creating web applications. 
            Many developers are already using Angular 1, 
            so the obvious question that comes to our mind is why should we use Angular 2. 
        
            <p>
                Angular 2 is not a simple upgrade from angular 1.
                 Angular 2 is completely rewritten, so it has lot of 
                 improvements when compared with Angular 1. Let's look
                 at a few of these improvements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Performance : From a performance standpoint, Angular 2 has faster initial loads, 
                 change detection, and improved rendering time. Not just performance, we also have
                 improved modularity, Dependency injection and testability. 
                 According to angular conference meetup, Angular 2 is 5 times faster 
                 compared to AngularJS 1.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Mobile Support : Angular 1 was not built for mobile devices. It is possible to run 
                Angular 1 on mobile but we will have to use other frameworks. Angular 2 on the other
                 hand is designed from the ground up with mobile support. Mobile device features and 
                 limitations like touch interfaces, limited screen real estate, and mobile hardware 
                 have all been considered in Angular 2. So with Angular 2 we can build a single
                 application that works across mobile and desktop devices.

            <h2>Component Based Development</h2>    
            <p>    
                Component based web development is the future of 
                web development. In Angular 2, "everything is a component". Components are the 
                building blocks of an Angular application. The advantage of the component-based 
                approach is that, it facilitates greater code reuse. From unit testing standpoint, 
                the use of components make Angular2 more testable. We will discuss what a 
                component is and how to build components with examples in detail, in our upcoming 
                videos. 
            </p>
            <p>
                More language choices : There are several languages that we can use to develop Angular
                 applications.<br> To name a few, we have<br>
                  1. ECMAScript 5<br> 
                  2. ECMAScript 6 (also called ES 2015)<br>
                  3. TypeScript etc. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides these 3 languages we can also use Dart, PureScript, Elm, etc, but among all 
                these, TypeScript is the most popular language. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Angular 2 itself, is built using TypeScript.
                 TypeScript has great support of ECMAScript 6 standard. 
                 So the obvious questions that come to our mind at this point are<br>
                1. What is ECMAScript <br>
                2. Wha is Type Script
            </p>
        
            
            <h2>What is ECMAScript</h2>     
            <p> The JavaScript language standard is officially called ECMAScript. 
                Over the past several years many versions of ECMAScript were released starting with 
                ECMAScript version 1 all the way till ECMAScript version 7.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Most of the modern browsers available today support ECMAScript 5. The browser support 
                for ECMAScript 6 is still incomplete. However, using a process called Transpilation, 
                ECMAScript 6 can be converted to ECMAScript 5 which is supported by all the modern 
                browsers. ECMAScript 6 is officially known as ECMAScript 2015. ECMAScript 2015 
                introduced several new features like classes, modules, arrow functions etc.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                If you are interested in reading more about the ECMAScript standard and what these 
                different versions of ECMAScript have to offer, please refer to the the following 
                Wikipedia article.<br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" style="color:blue">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript</a> 
            </p>
        
            
            <h2>What is Type Script</h2>    
            <p>
                TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language 
                developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript and compiles to JavaScript 
                through a process called transpilation. Using TypeScript to build angular 
                applications provides several benefits.
                <br>1. Intellisense 
                <br>2. Autocompletion 
                <br>3. Code navigation 
                <br>4. Advanced refactoring 
                <br>5. Strong Typing 
                <br>6. Supports ES 2015 (also called ES 6) features like classes, interfaces and inheritance. If you have any experience with object oriented programming languages like C# and Java, learning TypeScript is easy.
