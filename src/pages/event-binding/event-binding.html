      <h2>Event Binding in Angular 2</h2>

      <p>
          In this video we will discuss Event Binding in Angular with examples.
      </p>

      <p>
          The following bindings that we have discussed so far in this video series flow data in one direction 
          i.e from a component class property to an HTML element property.
      </p>
      <p>
          1. Interpolation <br>
          2. Property Binding <br> 
          3. Attribute Binding<br> 
          4. Class Binding <br>
          5. Style Binding
      </p>
      <p>
          How about flowing data in the opposite direction i.e from an HTML element to a component. 
          When a user performs any action like clicking on a button, hovering over an element, 
          selecting from a dropdownlist, typing in a textbox etc, then the corresponding event 
          for that action is raised. We need to know when user performs these actions. 
          We can use angular event binding to get notified when these events occur.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fullpage_content">
        <expandable showText="See the code" hideText="Hide the code">
          <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="1">
              <button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
          </textarea>
        </expandable> 
        
    <p>
        With event binding we can also use the on- prefix alternative as shown below. This is known as the canonical form
    </p>

    <expandable showText="See the code" hideText="Hide the text">
      <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="1">
          <button on-click="onClick()">Click me</button>
      </textarea>
    </expandable>
    
    <h2>
      Event Binding Example
    </h2>

    <expandable showText="See the code" hideText="Hide the text">
      <textarea class="codepart" cols="50" rows="10">
          import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
          
          @Component({ 
            selector: 'my-app', 
            template: `<button (click)='onClick()'>
                            Click me
                        </button>` 
          }) 
          export class AppComponent { 
            onClick(): void { 
              console.log('Button Clicked'); 
            } 
          } 
      </textarea>
    </expandable>

    <p>
        Every time we click the button, 'Button Clicked' message is logged to the console.
        You can see this message under the Console tab, in the browser developer tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another Example : Initially when the page loads we want to display only the First 
        Name and Last of Employee. We also want to display "Show Details" button.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When we click "Show Details" button, we want to display "Gender" and "Age" as well. 
        The text on the button should be changed to "Hide Details". When we click "Hide Details" button, 
        "Gender" and "Age" should be hidden and the button text should be changed to "Show Details".
    </p>

    <p>
        To achieve this we will make use of event binding in Angular. 
        We will also make use of one of the structural directives "ngIf" in angular.
    </p>

    <p>
        Code in employee.component.ts : Notice we have introduced "showDetails" boolean property. 
        The default value is false, so when the page first loads, we will have "Gender" and "Age" 
        hidden.
        We also have a method, toggleDetails(), which toggles the value of showDetails. 
    </p>

    <expandable showText="See the code" hideText="Hide the code">
      <textarea class="codepart" rows="10" cols="50">
          import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
          
          @Component({ 
            selector: 'my-employee', 
            templateUrl: 'app/employee/employee.component.html', 
            styleUrls: ['app/employee/employee.component.css'] 
          }) 
          export class EmployeeComponent { 
            columnSpan: number = 2; 
            firstName: string = 'Tom'; 
            lastName: string = 'Hopkins'; 
            gender: string = 'Male'; 
            age: number = 20; 
            showDetails: boolean = false; 
          toggleDetails(): void { 
            this.showDetails = !this.showDetails; 
            } 
          } 
      </textarea>
    </expandable>
    
    <p>
        Code in employee.component.html : 
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice the click event of the button is binded to toggleDetails() method To dynamicall 
        change the text on the button, 
        <br>
        we are using ternary operator - [showDetails ? 'Hide' : 'Show']
        Details We used ngIf structural directive on "Gender" and "Age" [tr] elements 
        The * prefix before a directive indicates, it is a structural directive Besides ngIf, 
        there are other structural directives which we will discuss in our upcoming videos 
        The ngIf directive conditionally adds or removes content from the DOM based on 
        whether or not an expression is true or false If "showDetails" is true, 
        "Gender" and "Age" [tr] elements are added to the DOM, else removed
